# Python STL Toolkit (!! WIP !!)

- This program is designed as an alternative tool for software as Chitubox etc.
- So far, it can open STL model files and display in a 3 dimensional frame.

## How to use?

- Import the necessary modules.
- Just run "run.py" and it will prompt to locate an STL file.

## Problems

- Even the simplest STL 3D models have hundred thousands of vertices and meshes, causing program to run very slow.
- Models with unconnected meshes crash the program upon import.

## Upcoming Features

- Slicing, resin control interface, adding/removing material from model
